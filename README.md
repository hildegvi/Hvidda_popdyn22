# Hvidda_popdyn22



These R-scripts are used to perform the analysis of population dynamics of reindeer at Hardangervidda presented in the manuscript "Mysterud, A., et al. (2022) An emerging infectious disease causing mortality event in wild alpine reindeer".
The models, and code to run the models, are slight variations of model code made by Erlend B. Nilsen (NINA) and reported at https://github.com/ErlendNilsen/CiR_usage

- File «Running_ModelHV_2005to21_C_UpdatedM1&2_v2.R» - Includes code to prepare data, run models and generate figure 2 in the ms.
- File «Plot_compare_model_estimates.R» - Includes code to generate figures presented in Supplementary Material of the manuscript.
- File «Appendix 3 Simulated_Data» – Thise is a copy of the file from github.com/ErlendNilsen/CiR_usage. R-code used for generating initial values of population size and structure.
- File «Data_Hardangervidda_2005_2021v2.csv»: Data set summarizing yearly harvest and population surveys 2005-2021.
